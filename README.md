# Supervised-Learning-with-Linear-Regression

This project is based on applyingfinding a best fit line to predict outcome of new values given some values.
The implementation involves use of linear regression and the type of machine learning problem is called supervised learning.

Steps to successfully rum the project:
1) Install prerequisite libraries:- 
  a)numpy (cmd: pip install numpy)
  b)matplotlib (cmd: pip install matplotlib)
  
2) Open console where the project is saved and execute linearReg.py file by - "python linearReg.py".(Note that this file is a python 3 file so I would recommend you to change the above command accordingly if you have both python 2.7 and python 3 installed.)
